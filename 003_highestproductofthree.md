# Highest Product of 3
###### [Date]

**Given a list of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.**

The input list_of_ints will always have at least three integers.

For example:
```
Given: [-10, -10, 1, 3, 2]
Your method should return: 300
By calculating: -10 * -10 * 3
```

_Here's the catch: Make sure your method works with negative numbers!_
