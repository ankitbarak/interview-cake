  # We're going to start at the 3rd item (at index 2) so pre-populate highests
  # and lowests based on the first 2 items. We could also start these as nil and
  # check below if they're set but this is arguably cleaner.

  # our first pass it'll check against itself, which is fine.
  highest_product_of_3 = array[0] * array[1] * array[2]

  # Walk through items, starting at index 2 (we could slice the array but that would use n space)
  array.each_with_index do |current, index|
