# Product of All Other Numbers
###### [Date]

You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.

**Write a method get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.**

For example:
```
Given: [1, 7, 3, 4]

Your method would return: [84, 12, 28, 21]

By calculating: [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]
```

_Here's the catch: **You can't use division in your solution!**_
