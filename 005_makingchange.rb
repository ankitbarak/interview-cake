# TODO:
# Write a function that computes the number of ways to make the amount of money
# with coins of the available denominations, given (1) an amount of money, and
# (2) a list of coin denominations.

# EXAMPLE:
# amount = 4 (4¢)
# denominations = [1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢)

# 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
# 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
# 1¢, 3¢
# 2¢, 2¢
